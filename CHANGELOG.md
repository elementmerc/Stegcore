## [3.0.0-dev] — 2026-03-21

Complete rewrite. Rust + Tauri v2 replaces Python + PyInstaller.

### Engine
- Full Rust engine with three AEAD ciphers + Argon2id
- Direct Rust crate dependency (replaced C FFI boundary)
- Parallel batch analysis with rayon
- Magic byte validation (PNG, BMP, JPEG, WAV, WebP, FLAC)
- File size limits with clear error messages
- Fixed: `extract_with_keyfile` now auto-detects embedding mode
  (was hardcoded to sequential, breaking adaptive-mode key file extraction)
- Fixed: Adaptive mode variance calculation now uses upper 7 bits (LSB-immune),
  preventing embed/extract slot mismatch on large images
- Fixed: WAV sample read errors now propagate instead of being silently dropped
- Fixed: JPEG restart marker decode/encode (sequence counter + raw byte skip)
- Fixed: Two-pass extraction reads only header + metadata + ciphertext (not full image)
- Fixed: Passphrase seed XOR-fold preserves entropy beyond 32 bytes
- Fixed: Chi-squared distribution formula corrected
- Release profile: LTO + codegen-units=1
- 87 engine unit tests, 81.7% line coverage

### GUI
- Tauri v2 desktop app (~10 MB native binary)
- React + TypeScript frontend with step-by-step wizards
- First-run setup wizard (AUP, licence, preferences)
- Animated steganalysis dashboard with four chart types:
  - Chi-Squared lateral slide (per-channel p-values)
  - RS Analysis untangle (4-curve divergence)
  - Sample Pair Analysis arc sweep gauge (with confidence)
  - LSB Entropy corner ripple heatmap (10×10 grid)
  - Audio oscilloscope trace (WAV/FLAC waveform with LSB highlighting)
- Progressive two-phase analysis (fast preliminary + background full)
- Before/after pixel diff on embed success
- Copy dashboard to clipboard as image
- PDF/HTML/JSON/CSV export from cached reports
- Keyboard shortcuts (E/X/A/L/R/?)
- Interface size scaling (small/default/large/xl)
- Dark and light themes with live switching
- Reduce-motion support
- Clipboard auto-clear after configurable timeout
- Skeleton loaders for lazy-loaded routes
- Success sound (optional, via Web Audio API)
- Format recommendations on cover file selection
- Smart output naming (auto-generated from input)
- Error recovery suggestions
- Stable footer (no layout shift between routes)

### CLI
- Shell completions (Bash, Zsh, Fish)
- Config file (~/.config/stegcore/config.toml)
- `stegcore doctor` — system health check
- `stegcore benchmark` — real cipher throughput test
- `stegcore diff` — pixel comparison between files
- `stegcore verse` — daily Bible verse
- Pipe support (stdin payloads, `--raw` stdout for binary)
- `--quiet` mode (exit code only)
- `--watch` mode (directory monitoring)
- Coloured help output with clap styles
- Progress ETA on batch operations
- Elapsed time on all spinners
- Smart output naming (auto-generated when `-o` omitted)

### Security
- Content Security Policy enabled in Tauri
- Passphrase env var warnings in help text
- Path canonicalisation in IPC commands
- Config directory created with 0o700 permissions
- TOCTOU fixes (direct file opens, no pre-checks)
- Oracle-resistant error messages
- CLI passphrase zeroization after use (Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>)
- Key files written with 0o600 permissions (Unix)
- Deniable metadata no longer reveals deniable mode (deniable field always false)
- Deniable partition half randomised (adversary cannot infer which is real)
- Deniable key files only written when --export-key is explicitly set
- Empty decoy passphrase rejected with clear error
- Unused tauri-plugin-fs removed (reduced attack surface)
- Passphrase cleared from Zustand stores after successful embed/extract
- KDF parameters removed from public documentation
- Decompression bomb capped at 256 MB
- JPEG extract allocation capped to coefficient capacity

### Polish
- Backdrop blur on settings panel overlay
- Spring physics on all interactive buttons (cubic-bezier bounce)
- Dashboard chart cards lift on hover
- Drop zone hover lift with shadow
- Contextual tooltips on cipher/mode selectors
- Box-drawn summary cards in CLI output (Unicode borders)
- Summary card after CLI embed (cover, output, cipher, mode)
- Inline examples in `--help` for embed, extract, analyse
- Bible verse footer auto-scrolls on 5s idle, snaps back on interaction
- Before/after pixel diff shown on embed success

### Distribution
- One-liner install script (Linux/macOS)
- Homebrew formula
- Winget manifest
- Kali Linux packaging
- SourceForge release notes
- Comprehensive integration test suite (357 tests across 35+ categories)
