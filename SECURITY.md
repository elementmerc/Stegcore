# Stegcore — Security

What Stegcore protects against, what it doesn't, and how to use it sensibly. Worth reading before you use it for anything that actually matters.

## What Stegcore is

Stegcore is a **crypto-steganography** tool. It combines two distinct techniques:

**Cryptography**: Your payload is encrypted before it's embedded. Even if someone extracts the hidden data, they can't read it without the correct passphrase. All three supported ciphers (Ascon-128, ChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-256-GCM) are AEAD schemes. Any tampering with the ciphertext is detected on decryption.

**Steganography**: The encrypted payload is hidden inside an ordinary image or audio file. The cover file looks and sounds completely normal. The goal is that someone who intercepts or examines it has no reason to suspect a hidden message exists.

Used together, these give you two independent layers of protection: concealment (they don't know there's a message) and confidentiality (even if they suspect there is one, they can't read it).

---

## Threat model

Stegcore is designed to hold up against the following:

**Passive observer**: Someone who can see the stego file but isn't actively looking for hidden data. The stego image is visually indistinguishable from the original.

**Casual forensic examiner**: Someone running basic file analysis (strings, exiftool, hex dump). Encrypted payloads produce high-entropy output with no readable strings or obvious structure.

**Automated file scanning**: Content scanners, email gateways, or cloud services checking for known file signatures or patterns. The embedded data has no fixed signature.

**Coercion, with deniable mode**: If you're forced to reveal a passphrase, deniable mode lets you hand over the decoy passphrase and decoy key file. The real payload stays hidden and inaccessible. Neither key file is structurally distinguishable as real or fake.

## What Stegcore doesn't protect against

Let me be real with you about relying on this software for anything high-stakes.

**Dedicated steganalysis tools**

Tools like StegExpose, zsteg, and ML-based detectors (SRM, SPAM, GFR) analyse the statistical properties of pixel distributions rather than looking for visible changes. Standard LSB steganography is reliably detected by these tools. Stegcore's adaptive mode significantly raises the detection threshold, but doesn't make detection impossible — particularly at high payload density on low-quality covers. If your adversary is running automated ML-based steganalysis across a large corpus of files, Stegcore provides meaningful but not absolute resistance.

Stegcore includes a built-in steganalysis suite that runs five detectors
against any file: Chi-Squared (block-based), Sample Pair Analysis (DWW
quadratic), RS Analysis (per-channel), LSB Entropy (per-channel
autocorrelation), and Tool Fingerprinting. You can test your own output
before sharing it. The GUI shows animated charts and heatmaps of the
detection results.

**Traffic analysis and metadata**

Stegcore doesn't touch file metadata (EXIF, creation timestamps, file sizes). Sending a 4.2 MB PNG that's exactly 4.2 MB larger than any photo you've previously shared may itself be a signal. Normalise file sizes if this matters to your threat model.

**Endpoint compromise**

If an adversary has access to the machine where you run Stegcore, they can recover the passphrase from memory, keyloggers, or process inspection. Stegcore clears passphrases from its own variables after use, but can't protect against OS-level compromise.

**Key file exposure**

The key file contains the nonce, salt, and cipher metadata. Without the passphrase it's useless. However, its existence confirms that steganographic embedding occurred. Don't store the key file alongside the stego file if concealing the operation itself matters.

**Passphrase weakness**

Argon2id makes brute-forcing expensive, but a short or common passphrase can still be cracked with sufficient motivation and computing power. Use a strong, unique passphrase of at least 14 characters.

**WAV transcoding**

WAV sample LSB embedding won't survive conversion to MP3, AAC, or any other lossy audio format. Only use WAV covers when you control the file from embed to extract with no transcoding in between.

**Network-level analysis**

Stegcore hides data inside files. It doesn't protect the transmission of those files. If you send a stego file over an unencrypted channel, it can be intercepted and analysed. Use Stegcore alongside secure transport (Signal, encrypted email, HTTPS) — not instead of it.

## Cryptographic decisions

**Key derivation:** Argon2id with parameters that meet the current OWASP minimum recommendations. The derived key length matches the cipher requirements. A single passphrase guess requires significant RAM, constraining GPU-based cracking.

**Ciphers:** All three ciphers are AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data). The ciphertext includes an authentication tag. Decryption fails with an explicit error if the ciphertext has been modified or if the wrong passphrase is used. There's no "partial decryption" that produces garbled output. Only clean success, or clean failure.

**Nonces:** Generated with OS-provided cryptographic randomness (`OsRng`)
per operation, never reused, stored in the embedded metadata for extraction.

**No passphrase storage:** The passphrase is never written to disk,
logged, or included in the key file. It exists only in memory for the
duration of the operation and is explicitly cleared using `zeroize`
after use.

## Deniable mode — The realistic assessment

Deniable mode provides **technical deniability**, not legal immunity. A few things worth thinking through honestly:

The embedded metadata does not reveal whether deniable mode was used — both payloads appear as standard single-payload embeds. Partition assignments are randomised so neither half is structurally identifiable as "real" or "decoy". Key files are only written when explicitly requested (`--export-key`), since their existence on disk confirms steganographic activity.

Deniable mode works best when:
- The decoy content is genuinely plausible (not obviously fabricated)
- The decoy passphrase is as strong as the real one
- The adversary doesn't already know the real content exists

Deniable mode doesn't protect against an adversary who can observe you using Stegcore and knows you embedded two payloads. It protects against one who only has access to the files themselves.

In jurisdictions with key disclosure laws (e.g. the UK's RIPA Part III), you may be legally required to disclose encryption keys. In such cases, deniable mode provides plausible cover for handing over the decoy passphrase. If this is relevant to your situation, stop reading this, pick up the phone, and call your lawyer.

## Responsible use

Stegcore is a neutral technology. It can protect privacy, secure intellectual property, support journalism, and enable digital rights. It can also be misused.

By using Stegcore you agree to:

- Use it only in ways that are lawful in your jurisdiction
- Not use it to facilitate harm to others
- Not use it to circumvent legitimate law enforcement activity where you have no right to do so

In the UK (where this software was developed), steganography is not illegal. The Computer Misuse Act 1990 applies to unauthorised access to computer systems, but not to the use of privacy tools on your own files. The Investigatory Powers Act 2016 covers surveillance, not the development of privacy software. If you're unsure about the legal position in your jurisdiction, once again, stop reading this, pick up the phone, and call your lawyer.

## Privacy by design

Stegcore makes **no network connections whatsoever**. No telemetry, no
analytics, no update checks, no CDN fonts, no external API calls.
Everything runs locally on your machine.

- System font stack — no external font loading
- No external dependencies loaded at runtime
- Config stored locally in `~/.config/stegcore/` with restrictive
  permissions (0o700 on Unix)
- Passphrases are never written to disk — only held in memory during
  the operation and cleared immediately after
- Clipboard auto-clear after configurable timeout (default 30 seconds)
- No logging of sensitive data (passphrases, payload content, file paths)

Run `stegcore doctor` to verify the application has no unexpected
dependencies or connections.

## Reporting security issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in Stegcore, please report it privately rather than opening a public issue. Use the repository's security advisory system or email daniel@themalwarefiles.com. And for the love of everything on God's green earth, please don't disclose vulnerabilities publicly until they've been assessed and a fix is available.
